        "The prevalence of dry eyes in the community is increasing. Atilla noted that they categorize the prevalence of diseases into childhood and adulthood and made the following remarks: In childhood, looking closely at screens, especially watching tablets and phones at night with lights off, increases myopia. Working closely with screens disrupts clear vision in the eyes, leading to a rise in myopia cases. Prolonged close-up work in children, particularly if there is an uncorrected need for glasses, can trigger eye misalignment, or strabismus. During the COVID-19 period, the increased use of tablets and phones for spending time and online lessons caused a rise in inward eye misalignment. We have started seeing early-onset dry eye disease more frequently in children. The prevalence of dry eye disease is increasing across all age groups. The most significant reason for this is improper use of light-emitting devices such as tablets, phones, and computers.",

Modern lifestyle factors, such as excessive screen time, significantly contribute to the prevalence of dry eye disease. Children spending hours on phones is a notable reason for dry eyes. Environmental factors like seasonal changes, high temperatures, dusty environments, or prolonged exposure to air conditioning also exacerbate the condition. Contact lens misuse, poor hygiene, and inadequate choices further worsen dry eyes. Symptoms include a sensation of dryness, irritation, burning, and even blurred vision. Patients are advised to limit screen time, maintain proper environmental conditions, and seek medical treatments such as artificial tears or medications for inflammation if needed.'",

In the U.S., approximately 65,000 new cases of kidney cancer are reported annually. Symptoms such as blood in the urine, weight loss, and appetite loss can signal kidney tumors. However, experts stress that not every kidney tumor is cancerous and emphasize the importance of accurate treatment approaches. Prof. Dr. Serdar Aykan from Memorial Bahcelievler Hospital stated that obesity, smoking, occupational chemical exposure, long-term kidney stones, and genetic factors increase kidney tumor risks. Tumors are usually slow-growing, with annual growth rates of up to 0.7 millimeters. The risk of metastasis depends on the tumor's size, being as low as 3-5% for tumors smaller than 4 cm.",

Dry eye symptoms arise when there is insufficient tear production or poor tear quality. The tear film consists of three layers: mucous, aqueous, and lipid. A deficiency or dysfunction in any of these layers can lead to irritation and reduced vision. Factors like hormonal changes, aging, and menopause further increase the risk. Dr. Ozkok advised seeking medical attention for symptoms and stressed the importance of preventive measures such as limiting screen time and maintaining proper hydration.",
